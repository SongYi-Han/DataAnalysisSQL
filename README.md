**10-Year Statistical Overview**  
  
Overall, the number of traffic accident is much lower in 2000s. For the car accidents, 1990s has the highest number and it might be becasue the number of personal car increased and also there were more vehicles on the road compared to 1980s. In case of ferry and airplane accident, the number of accident tends to increase and it might be simply because the number of usage have been increased.
